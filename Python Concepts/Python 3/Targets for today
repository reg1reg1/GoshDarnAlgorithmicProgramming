Targets for today
1)Dictionary Controller:
	Handle the usual error
	Return a dictionary generated based on the no of words passed as JSON
	Return graceful error if no of words is >70 or <1

2) Prevent KeyGenerator service from returning a hard raw data to controller
	Create a separate method, which returns the key dto instead of the raw key being generated
	Both keygeneration is important, the dto part and the non dto part
3)Create an issue for the KeyGenerator handling and tie it to the issue in Development
